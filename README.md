# Hi there, I'm Anatoli 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a software testing engineer with over 5 years of experience in automation testing, primarily focusing on web-UI automation. I'm passionate about setting up efficient test automation frameworks, enhancing CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring quality throughout the development process.

## 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Test automation projects, especially with a focus on iOS and web applications.
- Open-source contributions in the field of test automation.

## 📫 How to reach me:
- LinkedIn: [asarachynski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asarachynski/)

## ⚡ Fun fact:
I once watched *The Office* and *How I Met Your Mother* on repeat with my girlfriend, and I’m always looking for a new show to binge-watch. Also, I like to push myself to walk 10,000 steps every day and keep fit!
